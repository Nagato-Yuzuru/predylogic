# Design & Architecture

Welcome to the architectural documentation of **Predylogic**. This section details the internal design decisions,
trade-offs, and performance considerations.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

We use ADRs to document significant architectural changes.

* [ADR 001: Evaluation Engine Migration](adr/001_evaluation_engine.md) - Why we moved from Recursive Closures
  to an Iterative AST Engine.
* [ADR 002: AST compiler optimization](adr/002_AST_compiler_optimization.md) - What attempts have we made?
